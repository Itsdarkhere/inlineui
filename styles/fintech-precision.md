# Fintech Precision

Data-driven confidence. Where every pixel serves the bottom line.

---

## Philosophy

Information is currency. This style treats data with the respect it deserves — presenting it clearly, confidently, and without distraction. Inspired by Bloomberg terminals, trading floors, and the quiet authority of institutions that move markets. Trust is built through precision.

---

## Visual Feeling

- **Authoritative**: Commands respect without demanding attention
- **Technical**: Built for professionals who read numbers all day
- **Efficient**: Every element has a job; nothing is decorative
- **Confident**: Bold decisions, no hedging, no ambiguity
- **Alert**: Ready to surface critical information instantly

---

## Color

Neutrals form the foundation. Yellow signals action and importance.

- **Primary palette**: Grays, whites, and blacks (Tailwind slate or neutral scale)
- **Brand accent**: Yellow-600 from Tailwind (`#CA8A04`) — used for primary actions, highlights, and key data points
- **Background**: White or very light gray for content; dark gray/black for contrast sections or dark mode
- **Text**: Near-black (`#0A0A0A`) on light, white on dark
- **Semantic colors**: Green for positive/profit, red for negative/loss, amber for warnings
- Yellow accent appears on: primary buttons, active states, important metrics, navigation highlights
- Use yellow sparingly — it should draw the eye to what matters most

---

## Typography

Clarity meets technical precision.

- **Primary font**: IBM Plex Sans — clean, professional, excellent legibility at all sizes
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono for numbers, data tables, currency values, and code
- Strong hierarchy: bold headings, medium body, regular secondary
- Tabular numerals for aligned data columns
- Slightly tighter line-height in data-dense areas
- All-caps for labels, badges, and status indicators
- Numbers should feel engineered, not decorative

---

## Space

Dense but not cramped. Efficient but not claustrophobic.

- Compact spacing in data tables and dashboards
- Generous padding in cards and content sections
- Consistent 4px/8px grid system
- Breathing room around key metrics and CTAs
- Tight vertical rhythm in lists and data rows
- Clear visual separation between logical sections

---

## Shape & Texture

Sharp, structured, intentional.

- Minimal border radius (2-4px) — professional, not playful
- 1px borders in gray for structure and separation
- Subtle shadows only for elevated components (modals, dropdowns)
- No gradients except subtle ones for depth in dark mode
- Grid lines and dividers are functional, not decorative
- High contrast between interactive and static elements

---

## Motion

Swift and purposeful. Time is money.

- Fast transitions (100-150ms maximum)
- Linear or ease-out timing — no bounce, no spring
- Instant feedback on interactions
- Number counters and tickers for live data
- Subtle fade for appearing/disappearing elements
- No animation that delays user action

---

## Personality

If this style were a person:
- Arrives early to every meeting
- Triple-checks the spreadsheet
- Wears a well-fitted suit in charcoal
- Owns a yellow-faced watch as their only bold accessory
- Values accuracy over creativity
- Speaks in facts, not feelings

---

## Embrace

- Data tables with clear hierarchy
- Real-time updating values
- Dashboard layouts with clear information zones
- Monospace numbers that align perfectly
- Status indicators and badges
- Yellow accents on dark backgrounds for maximum impact
- Keyboard shortcuts and power-user features

---

## Avoid

- Playful illustrations or mascots
- Rounded buttons or bubbly shapes
- Decorative gradients or glows
- Animation that takes more than 150ms
- Ambiguous icons without labels
- Color used for decoration rather than meaning
- Anything that feels casual or informal
- Yellow overuse — it loses power when everywhere
