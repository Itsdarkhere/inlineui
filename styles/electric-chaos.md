# Electric Chaos

Loud. Bold. Unapologetic. This style screams from across the room and doesn't care who's watching.

---

## Philosophy

More is more. If it's not making someone uncomfortable, you're not trying hard enough. Design rules exist to be broken. Subtlety is for cowards.

---

## Visual Feeling

- **Aggressive**: Everything fights for attention
- **Kinetic**: Feels like it's vibrating even when still
- **Irreverent**: Mocks traditional design sensibilities
- **Alive**: Colors pulse, shadows pop, nothing sits quietly

---

## Color

Color is not a tool — it's a weapon. Use all of it.

- Electric purple (`#8B5CF6`) as primary
- Acid green (`#84CC16`) for success and accents
- Hot pink (`#EC4899`) for emphasis
- Cyan (`#06B6D4`) for information
- Orange (`#F97316`) for warnings
- Pure black backgrounds with color explosions
- White text that cuts through the noise
- Gradients everywhere — the more neon, the better

---

## Typography

Big. Bold. Loud.

- Display font: Unbounded (for headings that punch)
- Body font: Space Grotesk (geometric, weird, good)
- Headings should be uncomfortably large
- All-caps for labels and buttons
- Tight line-height — pack it in
- Letter-spacing: wide on small text, tight on large
- Don't be afraid of font-weight 900

---

## Space

Dense and chaotic, but intentionally so.

- Tight padding inside components
- Large gaps between sections (contrast is drama)
- Asymmetry is welcome
- Let things overlap occasionally
- Negative space is just empty canvas — fill it

---

## Shape & Texture

- Heavy border radius (rounded-xl, rounded-2xl)
- Thick borders (2px, 3px)
- Colored shadows that glow (`shadow-purple-500/50`)
- Gradients on backgrounds, borders, everything
- Noise textures if you can
- Skewed elements, rotated badges

---

## Motion

Animation should be felt in your chest.

- Longer durations (300-500ms)
- Bouncy easing — spring physics
- Scale transforms on hover (grow things)
- Color transitions that shift through hues
- Shake on error
- Pulse on focus

---

## Personality

If this style were a person:
- Shows up to the party in neon
- Speaks too loud but everyone's listening
- Has opinions about everything
- Makes boring people nervous
- Somehow pulls it off

---

## Embrace

- Clashing colors that somehow work
- Drop shadows with color
- Borders AND shadows together
- Multiple accent colors on one screen
- Hover states that transform dramatically
- Text that's almost too big

---

## Avoid

- Restraint
- Muted colors
- Subtle anything
- "Clean" or "minimal"
- Design that whispers
- Playing it safe
