# Editorial

Sophisticated. Authoritative. The quiet confidence of the world's finest publications.

## Philosophy

Let the content speak. This style draws from the timeless design language of prestigious newspapers and literary magazines — where typography is craft, whitespace is intentional, and every element serves the story. It believes in the power of restraint, the elegance of tradition, and the impact of a single, well-placed accent.

## Visual Feeling

- **Authoritative**: Commands respect without raising its voice
- **Refined**: Every detail considered, nothing accidental
- **Intellectual**: Appeals to readers who appreciate substance
- **Timeless**: Classic enough to outlast trends, modern enough to feel current
- **Warm**: Despite its sophistication, approachable and inviting

## Color

Neutrals are the foundation. Yellow is the signature.

- Brand colors: neutrals (grays, whites, blacks) + yellow-600 from Tailwind (`#CA8A04`) as the accent
- Off-white or warm white backgrounds for reading comfort
- Near-black for headlines (`#18181B` or zinc-900)
- Warm grays for body text (`#3F3F46` or zinc-700)
- Light grays for borders and dividers (`#E4E4E7` or zinc-200)
- Yellow-600 reserved for: links, highlights, pull quotes, accent lines
- Use yellow sparingly — its power comes from scarcity
- No other accent colors; let yellow own the page

## Typography

Type is the entire personality. Treat it with reverence.

- Heading font: Playfair Display — a modern serif with editorial pedigree
- Body font: Inter — clean, readable, steps aside for content
- Large, confident headlines (tight letter-spacing, proper hierarchy)
- Generous line-height for body text (1.7-1.8)
- Pull quotes in italic Playfair, oversized
- Bylines and metadata in small caps or uppercase Inter
- Limit weights: Regular and Bold for body, Medium and Bold for headings
- Serif for editorial voice, sans-serif for UI elements

---

## Space

Breathe like a broadsheet. Margins matter.

- Wide margins that frame content like a printed page
- Generous vertical rhythm between sections
- Tight internal padding in components
- Column widths optimized for reading (60-75 characters)
- Use horizontal rules sparingly but meaningfully
- Let important elements float in whitespace

---

## Shape & Texture

- Minimal border radius (0-4px) — sharp is sophisticated
- Thin, subtle borders in light gray
- No shadows except for dropdowns and modals
- No gradients
- Occasional use of thin yellow accent lines (underlines, left borders)
- Texture through typography, not pattern

---

## Motion

Movement should be imperceptible — like turning a page.

- Fast, subtle transitions (100-200ms)
- Ease-out curves
- Opacity changes over position changes
- Links: subtle underline animations
- No bounce, no spring, no playfulness
- Hover states: darkening, underlining, not scaling

---

## Personality

If this style were a person:
- Reads long-form journalism over coffee
- Owns nice stationery
- Speaks deliberately, never filler
- Appreciates craft and tradition
- Has strong opinions, expressed calmly
- The kind of quiet confidence that doesn't need to prove itself

---

## Embrace

- Serif headlines with sans-serif body text
- Generous use of whitespace
- Horizontal rules as section dividers
- Pull quotes and drop caps
- Subtle yellow accents that catch the eye
- Bylines, dates, and reading time in small, quiet type
- Cards with thin borders, no shadows
- Text links with elegant underlines

---

## Avoid

- Rounded buttons (too playful)
- Colored backgrounds (let content sit on white)
- Multiple accent colors
- Heavy shadows
- Playful or casual language in UI
- Animations that draw attention to themselves
- Overly bold or chunky UI elements
- Anything that feels startup-y or tech-forward
- Emoji in interfaces
