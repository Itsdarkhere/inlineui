# Minimal Clean

A restrained, Swiss-inspired aesthetic. Clarity over decoration. Every element earns its place.

---

## Philosophy

Less, but better. This style believes in the power of reduction — removing everything that doesn't serve a purpose until only the essential remains. Inspired by Dieter Rams, Swiss typography, and the confidence of empty space.

---

## Visual Feeling

- **Calm**: Nothing screams. The eye rests easy.
- **Precise**: Alignment is sacred. Every pixel considered.
- **Confident**: Simplicity requires courage. No embellishment to hide behind.
- **Timeless**: Avoid trends. This should look good in 10 years.

## Color

Black, white, and gray do 95% of the work. Color is medicine — powerful, so use sparingly.

- Pure white backgrounds
- Near-black text (`#111`)
- Gray for secondary information
- A single accent color only when action is required
- Semantic colors (red, green, amber) for meaning, not decoration

---

## Typography

Type is the hero. Let it breathe.

- One typeface family (Inter, Helvetica, or similar grotesque)
- Clear hierarchy through size and weight, not color
- Generous line-height for body text
- Tight tracking on large headings
- Uppercase sparingly, for labels only

---

## Space

Whitespace is not empty — it's structure.

- Generous margins around content
- Consistent rhythm between elements
- Sections breathe; components are compact
- When in doubt, add more space

---

## Shape & Texture

- Subtle border radius (not bubbly, not sharp)
- Borders over shadows for separation
- No gradients
- Flat colors, no noise or texture
- Shadows only for elevation (floating elements)

---

## Motion

Movement should be felt, not noticed.

- Fast transitions (100-150ms)
- Ease-out for entering, ease-in for leaving
- No bounce, no overshoot
- Opacity and position, rarely scale

---

## Personality

If this style were a person:
- Speaks quietly but commands attention
- Wears black, white, and gray
- Has one nice watch
- Says no more often than yes
- Values craft over novelty

---

## Avoid

- Decoration for decoration's sake
- Colored shadows or glows
- Rounded-full corners on rectangles
- More than 2 font weights on a page
- Transitions longer than 200ms
- Anything that feels "fun" or "playful"
