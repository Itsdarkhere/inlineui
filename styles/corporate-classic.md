# Corporate Classic

Timeless professionalism meets modern clarity.

---

## Philosophy

Corporate Classic embodies the refined aesthetic of established institutions. It draws from the visual language of Fortune 500 companies, prestigious law firms, and global consulting practices—organizations where trust, competence, and longevity are paramount. Every design decision prioritizes clarity over cleverness, substance over style, and enduring elegance over fleeting trends.

## Visual Feeling

- **Authoritative**: Commands respect through restraint and precision
- **Trustworthy**: Inspires confidence with proven, familiar patterns
- **Sophisticated**: Refined details signal attention to quality
- **Stable**: Grounded compositions that feel permanent and reliable
- **Efficient**: Every element serves a clear purpose

## Color

The palette is built on a foundation of neutrals—grays, whites, and blacks—that convey professionalism and timelessness. Brand accent color is **yellow-600 from Tailwind** (`#CA8A04`), used sparingly to highlight key actions, important information, and brand moments. This warm gold-yellow adds a touch of prestige and energy without compromising the serious, business-focused tone.

- **Primary backgrounds**: White (`#FFFFFF`), gray-50 (`#F9FAFB`)
- **Secondary backgrounds**: gray-100 (`#F3F4F6`), gray-200 (`#E5E7EB`)
- **Primary text**: gray-900 (`#111827`)
- **Secondary text**: gray-600 (`#4B5563`)
- **Muted text**: gray-400 (`#9CA3AF`)
- **Borders**: gray-200 (`#E5E7EB`), gray-300 (`#D1D5DB`)
- **Accent/Brand**: yellow-600 (`#CA8A04`) — use for CTAs, links, highlights, and brand moments
- **Dark surfaces**: gray-900 (`#111827`), gray-800 (`#1F2937`)

## Typography

**Inter** serves as the primary typeface—a modern, highly legible sans-serif designed for screens. Its neutral character and professional appearance make it ideal for corporate communications.

- **Headings**: Inter, font-weight 600 (semibold) or 700 (bold), tight letter-spacing (-0.025em)
- **Body**: Inter, font-weight 400 (regular), standard line-height (1.5-1.75)
- **Captions/Labels**: Inter, font-weight 500 (medium), slightly increased letter-spacing (0.025em), uppercase for labels
- **Scale**: Use a traditional typographic scale (12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60)

## Space

Generous whitespace signals confidence and allows content to breathe. Spacing follows an 8px base grid for consistency.

- **Component padding**: 16px, 24px, or 32px depending on component size
- **Section margins**: 48px to 96px vertical spacing between major sections
- **Content width**: Maximum 1280px for main content, 768px for text-heavy sections
- **Grid gutters**: 24px or 32px

## Shape & Texture

Minimal ornamentation. Shapes are geometric and precise.

- **Border radius**: Subtle—4px for small elements (buttons, inputs), 8px for cards and containers
- **Shadows**: Soft, diffused shadows for elevation. Use sparingly: `shadow-sm` for subtle lift, `shadow-md` for modals and dropdowns
- **Borders**: 1px solid borders in gray-200 or gray-300 to define sections and components
- **Textures**: None. Flat, solid colors only. No gradients except for very subtle hover states

## Motion

Understated and purposeful. Motion should never distract from content.

- **Duration**: 150ms for micro-interactions, 200-300ms for larger transitions
- **Easing**: `ease-out` for entrances, `ease-in-out` for state changes
- **Properties**: Opacity, transform (translate, scale). Avoid complex animations
- **Hover states**: Subtle background color shifts, slight shadow increases

## Personality

Corporate Classic speaks with quiet confidence. It does not shout or demand attention—it earns it through competence and consistency. The design should feel like a well-tailored suit: impeccable, appropriate, and never trying too hard.

The yellow-600 accent adds warmth to an otherwise cool palette, suggesting approachability within professionalism. Use it to guide users toward important actions and to inject moments of brand personality without overwhelming the composed aesthetic.

## Embrace

- Generous whitespace and breathing room
- Clear visual hierarchy with size and weight
- Consistent alignment and grid-based layouts
- Subtle dividers and borders to organize content
- Professional photography with muted, natural tones
- Data visualization with the accent color as highlight
- Formal but approachable microcopy

## Avoid

- Bright, saturated colors beyond the yellow-600 accent
- Playful illustrations or cartoon-style graphics
- Rounded, bubbly shapes (keep radii minimal)
- Trendy design patterns that may feel dated quickly
- Excessive animation or movement
- Casual or overly friendly language
- Decorative elements that do not serve a purpose
- Dark mode as default (light mode conveys openness and transparency)
