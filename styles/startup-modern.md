# Startup Modern

Clean, confident, and forward-thinking — where clarity meets innovation.

---

## Philosophy

Startup Modern is built on the principle that great design should feel effortless. It strips away unnecessary complexity to reveal interfaces that are immediately understandable, quietly confident, and deeply functional. Every element earns its place. White space is generous, interactions are intuitive, and the yellow accent punctuates the experience like a perfectly placed highlight in a well-edited document.

## Visual Feeling

- **Clarity**: Every element has purpose; nothing competes for attention unnecessarily
- **Confidence**: Bold choices executed with restraint — the design knows what it is
- **Approachability**: Professional without being cold; serious work can still feel human
- **Innovation**: Contemporary patterns that signal forward-thinking without being experimental
- **Polish**: The subtle refinements that separate good from exceptional

## Color

The palette is built on a foundation of neutrals — crisp whites, sophisticated grays, and deep blacks — creating a canvas that feels both premium and functional. **Yellow-600 from Tailwind (`#CA8A04`)** serves as the singular brand accent, used sparingly but decisively for primary actions, active states, and moments that deserve attention. This warm yellow brings energy and optimism without overwhelming the professional foundation.

- **Background**: White (`#FFFFFF`) and subtle grays (`gray-50`, `gray-100`)
- **Text**: Near-black (`gray-900`) for primary, medium grays (`gray-600`) for secondary
- **Accent**: Yellow-600 (`#CA8A04`) for buttons, links, highlights, and interactive elements
- **Borders**: Light grays (`gray-200`, `gray-300`) for subtle definition
- **Surfaces**: White cards on gray-50 backgrounds for layered depth

## Typography

Inter is the workhorse — a typeface designed for screens with excellent legibility at all sizes. Use medium weights (500) for UI elements, semibold (600) for emphasis, and regular (400) for body text. Headlines can go bold (700) but rarely heavier. Letter-spacing should be slightly tight for headlines, default for body. Line heights are comfortable: 1.5 for body text, 1.2–1.3 for headlines.

## Space

Generous but not wasteful. Use a consistent 4px/8px grid system. Padding inside components should breathe — 16px minimum for interactive elements, 24px or more for cards and sections. Margins between sections should create clear visual groupings. When in doubt, add more space. Cramped interfaces feel cheap; spacious ones feel premium.

## Shape & Texture

Corners are softly rounded — `rounded-lg` (8px) for cards and containers, `rounded-md` (6px) for buttons and inputs, `rounded-full` for avatars and tags. Shadows are subtle and layered: `shadow-sm` for cards at rest, `shadow-md` on hover. Avoid heavy drop shadows or harsh borders. Surfaces should feel like quality paper — smooth, matte, tactile without being textured.

## Motion

Transitions are quick and purposeful — 150ms for micro-interactions, 200–300ms for larger state changes. Easing should feel natural: `ease-out` for entrances, `ease-in-out` for continuous movements. Hover states respond immediately. Loading states are smooth, never janky. Motion should feel like the interface is alive and responsive, not animated for animation's sake.

## Personality

This is the design language of companies that ship. It's optimistic but grounded, innovative but not reckless. It respects users' time with clear hierarchies and obvious next steps. It's the kind of interface where you immediately know what to click, where the important things stand out, and where complexity is managed rather than exposed.

## Embrace

- Generous white space and breathing room
- Clear visual hierarchy with obvious primary actions
- Subtle shadows for depth and layering
- Consistent component patterns throughout
- Yellow accents used with intention and restraint
- Microcopy that's helpful and human
- Empty states that guide rather than dead-end
- Skeleton loaders and smooth transitions

## Avoid

- Gradients on buttons or UI elements (flat yellow is cleaner)
- More than one accent color competing for attention
- Heavy borders or harsh dividers
- Decorative elements without function
- Dense layouts that feel like dashboards
- Overly playful illustrations that undermine professionalism
- Slow, elaborate animations that delay users
- Low contrast text that sacrifices readability for aesthetics
